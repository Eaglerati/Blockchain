# Blockchain CTE
These are my projects for the Blockchain CTE course held by the great instructors over at BPGC.

My first project is related to the Ethereum network, coded on Solidity. The project here is the backend for an identity blackbox inspired from the Hyperledger Indie framework, though coded by me, a noob. The user can insert his details and a password, (through say an aadhar card scanner) which are then stored in the blockchain in a secure hashed format.
When the user wants to retrieve his data, he can then insert his username and password and the specific detail which he wants and recieve them as an output.
